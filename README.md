# space-bg.github.io
Space background made with HTML5 Canvas and JS. The stars are dinamic, so every time you refresh or change the size of the screen 
they will appear in different locations and with different sizes. This background is interactive, if you press the left button of
your mouse the stars will speed up giving the sensation of a space travel.

You can check this background here: https://lucianotorrano.github.io/space-bg.github.io/
